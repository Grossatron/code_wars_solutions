Prompt:

You will be given a list of strings. You must sort it alphabetically 
(case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then 
return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.



Solution:

function twoSort(s) {
  s.sort()
  let word = s[0]
  let finalResult = ''
  for(let i = 0; i < word.length - 1; i++){
    finalResult += word[i] + '***'
  }
  finalResult += word[word.length-1]
  return finalResult
}
