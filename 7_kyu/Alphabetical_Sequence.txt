Prompt:

In this kata you will be given a random string of letters and tasked with returning them as a string of 
comma-separated sequences sorted alphabetically, with each sequence starting with an uppercase 
character followed by n-1 lowercase characters, where n is the letter's alphabet position 1-26.

Example

alphaSeq("ZpglnRxqenU") -> "Eeeee,Ggggggg,Llllllllllll,Nnnnnnnnnnnnnn,Nnnnnnnnnnnnnn,Pppppppppppppppp,
Qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq,Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

Technical Details
The string will include only letters.
The first letter of each sequence is uppercase followed by n-1 lowercase.
Each sequence is separated with a comma.
Return value needs to be a string.



Solution:

function alphaSeq (str) {
    var alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
    var arr = str.toLowerCase().split('').sort();
    var string = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        var length = alphabet.indexOf(arr[i]) + 1;
        var s = arr[i].repeat(length);
        string.push(s[0].toUpperCase() + s.substring(1));
    };
    return string.join(',');
}
